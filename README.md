BioReco is a stand-alone recommender for bioRXiv preprints. It takes user input
either as preprint (**D**)igital (**O**)bject (**I**)dentifier or a series of
keywords as well as the category that user wants to get the suggestions in.

It returns a list of preprints with corresponding information on the title,
version, the final destination (if the preprint is published in a subscription
  journal). User then can visit the preprint or published subscription journal
  article.

## Keywords
  - Web-scraping
  - Collaborative Filtering (cosine similarities)
  - sPacy/SciSpacy
  - Mongo DB
  - Flask
  - Heroku

## Usage



## Improvements to be made

- ~~Add Flask app~~
- ~~Redo pickling on the old scraped categories~~
- Write tests
- Add docstrings and comments throughout the classes.
- Add visualization script
