BioReco is a stand-alone recommender for bioRXiv preprints. It takes user input
either as preprint **_D_** igital **_O_** bject **_I_** dentifier or a series of
keywords as well as the category that user wants to get the suggestions in.

It returns a list of preprints with corresponding information on the title,
version, the final destination (if the preprint is published in a subscription
  journal). User then can visit the preprint or published subscription journal
  article.

## Keywords
